Farming Mayor,

you recide over a small village with
- farm
{
    for example, the Farmer will them buy, rake,seed and water the farm each day untill it sprouts.
    seed takes moments, each day is 24, and it takes X moments for a plant to go to the next stage. for example
    a simple Turnip takes 96 moments, or 4 days to sprout.

    after growing, its taken and put in the box, where then the task is complete. the farmer gains momey on the task AND
    THE items sold that were put in.

    each task can only be made by the shop owner. who sells the seed. at the start you only have 5 Turnip seeds, so you can only
    make one task. but those tasks gains you money. money you can use to order more seeds, more seeds mean better tasks. and the farmer
    a bigger yield.

    it is not supposed to be... complex, the point of this si how the farmer is going to walk, act, etc.
}
- woodcutter
{
    Woodcutter tasks are simple, you need wood, HOWEVER, instead of you getting seed, you PAY for the wood. 
    for example

    you put out a task of 20 wood, each wood is 20 pieces of gold, meaning you need to put in 400 gold for the wood.
    however, that wood can then be sold to the farmer or blacksmith if they need it. the farmer to build new tools, the blacksmith
    to create better tools, which the farmer can make
}
- shop
{
    this is where you get in, you create tasks for the NPC's, which help you with the system

    tasks => money => resources => better tools => more profit better tasks => tasks

    this is the loop you go through, but make no mistake, there are some issues. for one. 
}
- blacksmith
{
    blacksmiths do one thing. they rather resources and perform actions
    - gather ore.
    - create items.

    
}

so whats the catch 
{
    each action takes time. one can only cut so much wood per day.
    one only has so much stamina. a way to counter it is leveling up. each stmaina point is exp, by
    using an exponential calculation one gains levels, and therefore gain more stamina.

    stmaina can be increased, time isn't. thsi is why there is a rift, do you take the more expesnive yield, less
    time to plant, more chance of a bad harvest. or do you spend your time doing with lesser wiht a slight chance of a miscarrage

    blacksmiths and woodcutter also take time doing an action. there are

    also so many trees one can cut, they regrow in X days.

    there are so many ores, those respawn in X days.
}

the challenges
{

    a map where one sees these three walk around and perform these actions

    {
        the map is a 2D grid based game.
    }
    {
        each character has their own unique character roll. they eprform independant of one another.
        their choices based on their actions.
    }
    {
        the way they move about. this is going to be the big challenge, whats the logic behind this and how
        will it perform. a simple way is that the farmer thinks in these steps.

        1 => {
            it goes out to the farm and waters the plants.
        }
        2 => {
            it calculates how many seeds it can plant (based on the tasks it has) and buys them and plants them
        }
        3 => {
            if they planted enough seeds AND their limit of tasks is not reached, they will go back and find another task.

            again, it ONLY gets a new task if either the DISTANCE to get there takes too long before bed, OR if they have not finished the yield OR if their
            tasks are at a limit.

            tasks are always given with the seeds. so one cannot do it without.

            each will be a simple function to check out.
        }
        4 => {
            each task is calculated underneath with how much stamina it is going to take divided by how muhc money it is going to make
            with the reward NOT the crops itself.

            for example, if it takes 100 stamina and 100 coins, it means its a 1. while 100 stamina and 200 coins means 2. so 2 wins
        }
        5 => {
            if any tasks given is already fullfilled party. for example. one has a task of 10 potatoes, but you already stored 5 of them. then
            a more complex caluclation need to be made.

            the farmer does not know what tasks are there until they're there.
        }

        why like this? its a node system that resets each day, this way it doens't check EVERYTHING, only the things NEEDED.

        there is a way to get softlocked. so what needs ot be tested is the price. the price for seed can change in future updates?
        whats important is that you set the price for the seed. a task is BOUGHT by coins. but the reward should always be better.

        there is one issue, what if you give him 10 seeds but only 9 sprout? thats up to you. you give him seeds and the amount,
        but the amount he needs to return can be less

        tasks given

        Seed amount
        given amount
        task reward

        that is it.

        taks can give multiple seeds and amounts, however, the farmer only gains money AFTER it is planted.

        you cna make taks without any seed at all, JUST to see the yield.

        crops 
        {
            while crops have a chance to fail, they also have a chance to double or even tripple

            lets say

            1/14
            1/54

            each crop has a stage, its only by the FIRST stage they check if it failed.
            with more expensive crops its in the first and second stage.
        }

    }
}
- (and future additions)

events
{
    Crops have a chance, depending on the crop, of a bad yield. a low level crop may give you less, but the
    chance of failure is less than a more expensive crop.
}

you reside over the Shop. you were send by the capital to grow the village, your job is

- to make orders, like quests, the farmer, woodcutter or the smith will deal with said quest.
